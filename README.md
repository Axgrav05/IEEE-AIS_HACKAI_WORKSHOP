# IEEE x AIS UTD Machine Learning Workshop

## Overview
Welcome to the **IEEE x AIS UTD Machine Learning Workshop**! This workshop introduces students to **Data Science and Machine Learning** concepts using Python and essential libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn.

The workshop is structured around a **real-world problem** related to **electronic component reliability**, inspired by MuRataâ€™s work in capacitors, sensors, and power solutions. Students will analyze an artificially generated dataset and build a **predictive model** to classify whether an electronic component will fail early or perform reliably.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this workshop, participants will:
- Understand the basics of **data science and machine learning**.
- Learn how to **generate, import, and explore datasets**.
- Perform **data visualization** using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- Preprocess data using Pandas and Scikit-Learn.
- Train and evaluate a **machine learning model** using Random Forest.

## Repository Contents
This repository contains the following files:

- **`IEEE_AIS_Solution.ipynb`** â†’ Instructorâ€™s full solution notebook with explanations.
- **`IEEE_AIS_Template.ipynb`** â†’ Studentâ€™s guided template notebook with `#TODO` sections.
- **`README.md`** â†’ This document with workshop details and instructions.

## Installation & Setup
To run this workshop, you will need **Google Colab** or a local Python environment. If using Google Colab:
1. Open **Google Colab**: [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Click **File > Open Notebook > GitHub**.
3. Paste this repository URL.
4. Open the **`ml_workshop_template.ipynb`** file to start the workshop.

For local execution, ensure you have Python installed and run the following command to install dependencies:
```sh
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Instructions for Participants
1. **Clone this repository** or open the student template in Google Colab.
2. Work through the notebook, filling in the `#TODO` sections.
3. Use `IEEE_AIS_Solution.ipynb` as a reference if needed.
4. Experiment with different machine learning models and hyperparameters!
